  \headerrow {\textbf{IIT Delhi Wifi Log Management System}} {Prof. Huzur Saran, December, 2015 - May, 2016}
  \begin{itemize} \item[]
  Developed a system to process logs from all wifi routers on campus and generate alerts for suspicious user login. Presently being used to detect wifi misuse and generate statistics to improve the overall campus network.
  \end{itemize}

\item[]
  \headerrow {\textbf{Automated Theorem Prover}} {Prof. S. Arun Kumar, October - November, 2015}
  \begin{itemize} \item[]
  Devised and Implemented a theorem prover based on Analytical Tableaux in SML. Proved invalidity of a First-order logic formula by successively applying tableaux rules thus finding contradictions and closing branches.Tested the prover with several tautologies.
  \end{itemize}

\item[]
  \headerrow {\textbf{Network Based Multiplayer Game}} {Prof. Huzur Saran, March - April, 2015}
  \begin{itemize} \item[]
  Designed a multi-player p2p network based game of space invaders where one has to shoot down aliens in a given set of lives using OpenGL for graphics and UDP sockets as network component. To maintain seamless continuity of the game during network outages, a player losing connection is replaced by an Artificial Intelligence bot.
